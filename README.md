# Smart Issue Tracker – Government IoT Monitoring System

This project is a frontend prototype developed for an Open Innovation hackathon.

## Problem
Community issues such as road damage, garbage, water leakage, and street light failures are often reported informally, leading to delays and lack of tracking.

## Solution
A role-based issue tracking system where:
- Citizens report problems
- Government officials review and assign tasks
- Workers resolve issues

## Key Features
- Role-based dashboards (Citizen, Government Official, Worker)
- Issue assignment workflow
- Status tracking (Pending → Assigned → Resolved)
- Photo upload and preview
- Activity logs
- Professional IoT-style UI

## Google Technology Used
- Google Fonts (UI/UX enhancement)

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in a browser.

## Future Scope
- Backend integration
- Real-time notifications
- Analytics dashboards
